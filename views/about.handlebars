<h1 class="text-white">About this Application</h1>
<p class="text-white">MovJot Application, MovJot is an application for Film makers to put down their movie idea before proper script development or production. They will be able to access their ideas anytime, anywhere. Many film makers sometimes miss out somethings during movie production which will require them going back to where they jotted down their movie idea or story building which sometime might be an issue, so with MovJot they can just easily login into their dashboard and fetch which ever data they want.
